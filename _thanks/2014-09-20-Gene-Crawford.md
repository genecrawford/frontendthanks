Front-End Conf has been one of those things for me, and all of us here at UnmatchedStyle, that has framed the community for the better. It has been put together year after year with great care and love and through it all Dan has remained positive and helpful to us all. That's how the man is built, he loves this stuff and gives it back whenever and however he can. That's a real hard thing to find.

I can only think of very few events that I enjoy from top to bottom as much as I do Front-End Conf. It was one of the first that we traveled to as a crew and started to become involved in the community outside of our own state. For that Dan i'm grateful and also thankful that you are part of our community.

You and Cherrie and the rest of your family have contributed something beautuful for us all to enjoy, so thank you, sincerely. Not many people realize the amount of negativity you have to let roll off your back when you organize an event and Dan has done it with grace and good will for as long as i've known him.

Thank you for everything Dan. Most of all thank you for allowing me to call you a friend sir.
